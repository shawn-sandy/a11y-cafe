# Perceivable

The first principle of WCAG 2.2 is "Perceivable," which states that information
and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can
perceive. This principle aims to ensure that all users, including those with
disabilities, can access and understand the content and functionality of a
website or application.

## Guideline 1.1: Text Alternatives

This guideline requires providing text alternatives for non-text content, such
as images, icons, and multimedia. Text alternatives should convey the same
information or function as the non-text content, allowing users who cannot
perceive the non-text content to understand its purpose.

Best practices:

- Provide meaningful and descriptive alternative text for images.
- Use null (`alt=""`) for decorative images that do not convey information.
- Provide transcripts or captions for audio and video content.

## Guideline 1.2: Time-based Media

This guideline focuses on providing alternatives for time-based media, such as
audio and video content. It requires captions, audio descriptions, and other
alternatives to ensure that users with disabilities can access and understand
the content.

Best practices:

- Provide captions for audio and video content.
- Offer audio descriptions for video content that conveys important visual
  information.
- Provide transcripts or sign language interpretations for audio content.

## Guideline 1.3: Adaptable

This guideline ensures that content can be presented in different ways without
losing information or structure. It includes requirements for providing
adaptable content, making it easier for users to perceive and understand the
information.

Best practices:

- Use semantic markup and structure content logically.
- Provide mechanisms to adapt the presentation of content (e.g., adjustable font
  size, high contrast mode).
- Ensure that content can be presented in different orientations (portrait or
  landscape) without loss of information.

## Guideline 1.4: Distinguishable

This guideline focuses on making it easier for users to see and hear content,
including separating foreground from background. It includes requirements for
color contrast, resizing text, and providing alternatives for audio and visual
content.

Best practices:

- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- Allow users to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or
  functionality.
- Provide alternatives for audio and visual content that rely on color or other
  visual cues.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can ensure that your
website or application is perceivable to users with diverse abilities, improving
the overall accessibility and user experience. Percievable
