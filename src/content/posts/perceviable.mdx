The "Perceivable" principle of the WCAG 2.2 guidelines focuses on ensuring that
information and user interface components are presented in a way that can be
perceived by all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This
principle covers guidelines related to text alternatives, time-based media,
adaptable content, and distinguishable content.

### Text Alternatives

Text alternatives should be provided for any non-text content, such as images,
icons, and multimedia, so that users who are blind or have low vision can
understand the content. This includes providing alternative text (alt text) for
images, captions or transcripts for audio and video content, and descriptions
for complex images or charts.

### Time-Based Media

Time-based media, such as audio and video, should be accessible to users who are
deaf or hard of hearing. This can be achieved by providing captions or
transcripts for audio content and audio descriptions or sign language
interpretation for video content.

### Adaptable Content

Content should be adaptable to different user needs and preferences. This
includes providing options for resizing text, adjusting contrast and color
schemes, and navigating content using keyboard or assistive technologies.

### Distinguishable Content

User interface components and content should be distinguishable from each other
and from the background. This includes ensuring sufficient color contrast,
providing clear visual and auditory cues, and avoiding content that may cause
seizures or physical reactions.

### Best Practices

- Use clear and descriptive alternative text for images and multimedia.
- Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content.
- Ensure that content can be resized and navigated using keyboard or assistive
  technologies.
- Maintain sufficient color contrast and avoid low-contrast color combinations.
- Provide clear visual and auditory cues for user interface components.
- Avoid content that may cause seizures or physical reactions.
