# POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust

POUR - Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust principles are the foundation of the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2. These principles provide a framework for creating
accessible web content that can be perceived, operated, understood, and robust
for all users, including those with disabilities.

## Perceivable

Web content should be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This
includes providing alternative text for non-text content, ensuring sufficient
color contrast, and providing captions or transcripts for audio and video
content.

## Operable

User interface components and navigation should be operable by all users,
including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers or
alternative input devices. This includes providing keyboard accessibility,
ensuring sufficient time for user interactions, and avoiding content that may
cause seizures or physical reactions.

## Understandable

Information and the operation of user interfaces should be understandable by all
users, including those with cognitive or learning disabilities. This includes
providing clear and consistent navigation, using simple and straightforward
language, and ensuring that content appears and operates in predictable ways.

## Robust

Web content should be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety
of user agents, including assistive technologies. This includes following coding
standards, providing alternative content for older browsers or assistive
technologies, and ensuring that content remains accessible as technologies
evolve.

### Best Practices

- Provide alternative text for images, charts, and other non-text content.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.
- Provide captions or transcripts for audio and video content.
- Ensure keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements.
- Provide clear and consistent navigation.
- Use simple and straightforward language.
- Follow coding standards and provide alternative content for older browsers or
  assistive technologies.
