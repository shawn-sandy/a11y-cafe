### What are ARIA Landmarks?

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks are a set of roles defined by the WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) specification. These landmarks help in defining the structure and regions of a web page in a way that assistive technologies, like screen readers, can understand and navigate more effectively.

### Why ARIA Landmarks Matter

### Enhanced Navigation

For users who rely on assistive technologies, ARIA landmarks provide a way to quickly navigate to specific sections of a web page. This is particularly useful for users with visual impairments who need to jump to the main content, navigation menu, or other key areas without having to listen to all the content sequentially.

### Improved User Experience

By using ARIA landmarks, you can improve the overall user experience for everyone, not just those using assistive technologies. They help in creating a more organized and semantically meaningful web page, which benefits all users.

### Key ARIA Landmark Roles

Here are the primary ARIA landmark roles and their purposes:

- `role="banner"`: Represents the site's header, typically containing the logo and site-wide navigation.
- `role="navigation"`: Defines a section containing navigation links.
- `role="main"`: Denotes the main content of the document.
- `role="complementary"`: Used for supplementary content that is related to the main content but not central to it.
- `role="contentinfo"`: Represents the footer, often containing metadata about the document or site.
- `role="search"`: Defines a region containing a search form.
- `role="form"`: Used to identify a form region.

### Best Practices for Using ARIA Landmarks

### Use Landmarks Appropriately

Apply ARIA landmarks to the correct sections of your web page to ensure that assistive technologies can navigate the content as intended. For example, use `role="navigation"` for your site's navigation menu and `role="main"` for the primary content.

### Combine with Semantic HTML

While ARIA landmarks are powerful, they are most effective when used in conjunction with semantic HTML. For example, using `<nav>` with `role="navigation"` provides a strong, clear signal to assistive technologies about the purpose of the section.

### Avoid Redundancy

Do not overuse landmarks or apply multiple landmarks to the same region, as this can confuse assistive technologies and users. Use them sparingly and only where they add value to the page structure.

### Code Examples

### Basic Usage of ARIA Landmarks

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ARIA Landmarks Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header role="banner">
        <h1>Website Title</h1>
        <nav role="navigation">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main role="main">
        <article>
            <h2>Article Title</h2>
            <p>This is an example of an article.</p>
        </article>
    </main>
    <aside role="complementary">
        <h2>Related Information</h2>
        <p>This is an example of complementary content.</p>
    </aside>
    <footer role="contentinfo">
        <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Combining Semantic HTML with ARIA Landmarks

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Semantic HTML with ARIA Landmarks Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header role="banner">
        <h1>Website Title</h1>
        <nav role="navigation">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main role="main">
        <article>
            <h2>Article Title</h2>
            <p>This is an example of an article.</p>
        </article>
    </main>
    <aside role="complementary">
        <h2>Related Information</h2>
        <p>This is an example of complementary content.</p>
    </aside>
    <footer role="contentinfo">
        <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
