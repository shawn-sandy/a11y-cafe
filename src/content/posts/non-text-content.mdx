## Non-text Content (Level A)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The "Non-text Content"
guideline (1.1.1) is a Level A success criterion, which means it is a
fundamental requirement for web accessibility.

### What is Non-text Content?

Non-text content refers to any content on a web page that is not presented as
text, such as images, icons, audio, video, or other multimedia elements. These
elements can be challenging for users with disabilities, particularly those who
are blind or have low vision, to perceive and understand.

### Purpose and Importance

The purpose of the "Non-text Content" guideline is to ensure that all non-text
content on a web page is accompanied by a text alternative that conveys the same
information or function as the non-text content. This allows users with
disabilities to access and understand the content, regardless of their ability
to perceive the non-text elements.

### Best Practices

To comply with the "Non-text Content" guideline, follow these best practices:

1. **Provide Text Alternatives**: For every non-text element on your web page,
   provide a text alternative that accurately describes the content or function
   of the element. This can be done using the `alt` attribute for images,
   `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for icons or other non-text elements, and
   captions or transcripts for audio and video content.

2. **Be Descriptive and Concise**: Text alternatives should be descriptive
   enough to convey the essential information or function of the non-text
   content, but also concise and easy to understand.

3. **Consider Context**: When writing text alternatives, consider the context in
   which the non-text content appears. The alternative should make sense within
   the surrounding content and provide enough information for users to
   understand its purpose.

4. **Use Appropriate Techniques**: Different types of non-text content may
   require different techniques for providing text alternatives. For example,
   complex images may require longer descriptions, while simple icons may only
   need a short label.

5. **Test and Validate**: Test your web pages with assistive technologies, such
   as screen readers, to ensure that the text alternatives are properly conveyed
   and provide a meaningful experience for users with disabilities.
