# Captions (prerecorded)

Captions are a text alternative for multimedia content that is synchronized with
the audio and visual content. They provide a textual representation of the
spoken words, sound effects, and other relevant audio information. Captions are
essential for making multimedia content accessible to individuals who are deaf
or hard of hearing, as well as those who prefer or need to consume content
without audio.

## WCAG 2.2 Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide specific guidelines
related to captions for prerecorded multimedia content:

**1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)** (Level A): Captions are provided for all
prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a
media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.

This guideline ensures that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing can
access the auditory information in prerecorded multimedia content.

### Purpose and Best Practices

The purpose of providing captions for prerecorded multimedia content is to
ensure equal access to information and entertainment for individuals with
hearing impairments or those who prefer or need to consume content without
audio.

Best practices for implementing captions include:

- Providing accurate and complete captions that capture all spoken words, sound
  effects, and other relevant audio information.
- Synchronizing captions with the corresponding audio and visual content.
- Ensuring that captions are easily readable and legible, with appropriate font
  size, color contrast, and positioning.
- Providing options for users to adjust caption settings, such as font size,
  color, and background opacity.
- Offering captions in multiple languages, if applicable, to accommodate diverse
  audiences.
