#### What is Narrator for Windows?

Narrator is a screen reader built into the Windows operating system. It reads aloud the text on the screen and provides descriptions of events such as notifications and calendar appointments. Narrator is an essential tool for users who are blind or have low vision.

### Understanding WCAG 2.2 Guidelines

WCAG 2.2 introduces specific guidelines to enhance web accessibility. These guidelines are divided into three conformance levels:
- **Level A**: Basic web accessibility features.
- **Level AA**: Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
- **Level AAA**: The highest and most complex level of web accessibility.

### Relevant WCAG 2.2 Guidelines for Screen Reader Support

1. **Guideline 1.3: Adaptable** - Content must be adaptable and capable of being presented in different ways without losing information or structure.
   - **1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)**: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.

2. **Guideline 2.1: Keyboard Accessible** - Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
   - **2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)**: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface.

3. **Guideline 4.1: Compatible** - Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
   - **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)**: For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined.

### Best Practices for Screen Reader Compatibility

- **Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**: ARIA landmarks, roles, properties, and states improve navigation and the understanding of web content.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to define the structure.
- **Form Labels**: Ensure all form elements have associated `<label>` elements.
- **Alternative Text**: Provide alt text for all images using the `alt` attribute.

### Code Examples

**Example 1: Semantic HTML**

```html
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This is an example of an article section.</p>
  </article>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>Contact us: email@example.com</p>
</footer>
```

**Example 2: ARIA Roles and Landmarks**

```html
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
<main role="main">
  <section aria-labelledby="section1">
    <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
    <p>Content for the first section.</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

### Sufficient Techniques and Failures

**Sufficient Techniques**:
- **Using the `aria-labelledby` property** to associate labels with form elements.
- **Ensuring links and buttons have discernible text** for screen readers.

**Common Failures**:
- **Failure to include a `lang` attribute** on the `<html>` element.
- **Inaccessible custom widgets** that do not use ARIA roles and properties.

### Screen Reader Support and Compatibility

Narrator for Windows works well with websites that adhere to the above guidelines. When designing for screen reader users:
- **Test with Narrator**: Regularly test your website with Narrator to ensure compatibility.
- **Provide clear instructions**: Users should understand how to navigate and interact with the content.
