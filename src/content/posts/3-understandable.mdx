# Understandable

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
web content more understandable for users with disabilities. This principle
focuses on ensuring that information and user interface components are presented
in a way that is easy to comprehend and operate.

## Relevant Guidelines

### 3.1 Readable

Content should be readable and understandable. This includes providing clear and
concise language, supplementing complex content with illustrations or examples,
and ensuring a consistent reading level appropriate for the target audience.

### 3.2 Predictable

Web pages should operate in a predictable manner. This means that users should
be able to anticipate the behavior of interactive elements, such as links, form
controls, and navigation menus.

### 3.3 Input Assistance

Users should be provided with appropriate assistance when inputting data. This
includes clear instructions, error prevention and correction mechanisms, and
context-sensitive help.

## How It Applies

Making content understandable is crucial for users with cognitive, learning, or
language disabilities. It ensures that they can comprehend the information
presented and interact with the website effectively.

## Purpose and Best Practices

The purpose of the Understandable principle is to ensure that all users,
regardless of their abilities, can access and understand the content and
functionality of a website. Best practices include:

- Using clear and simple language
- Providing definitions for technical terms or abbreviations
- Organizing content in a logical and hierarchical manner
- Offering alternative representations (e.g., illustrations, diagrams) for
  complex concepts
- Providing clear instructions and error messages for user input
- Ensuring consistent navigation and labeling throughout the website
