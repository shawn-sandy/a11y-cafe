The WCAG 2.2 guideline 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) addresses
the need for providing additional audio descriptions for prerecorded video
content. This guideline is at the AAA conformance level, which means it is
recommended for achieving enhanced accessibility.

### Purpose and Importance

Extended audio descriptions provide additional narration that describes
important visual details, such as characters, settings, and actions, that are
not conveyed through dialogue or sound effects alone. This is particularly
beneficial for users who are blind or have low vision, as it allows them to
fully understand and engage with the video content.

### How It Applies

This guideline applies to prerecorded video content, such as movies, TV shows,
and online videos. It requires that extended audio descriptions be provided for
all important visual information that is not already conveyed through dialogue
or sound effects.

### Best Practices

1. **Provide separate audio track**: Extended audio descriptions should be
   provided as a separate audio track that can be turned on or off by the user.
   This allows users who do not need the descriptions to enjoy the content
   without interruptions.

2. **Timing and placement**: The extended audio descriptions should be timed and
   placed appropriately, without overlapping with important dialogue or sound
   effects.

3. **Describe relevant visual information**: Focus on describing relevant visual
   information that is essential for understanding the content, such as
   characters, settings, actions, and visual cues.

4. **Use clear and concise language**: Descriptions should be clear, concise,
   and easy to understand, without unnecessary details or subjective
   interpretations.

5. **Involve people with disabilities**: Involve people with disabilities in the
   creation and testing of extended audio descriptions to ensure their
   effectiveness and usability.

### Code Examples

```html
<!-- HTML5 video with separate audio track for extended audio descriptions -->

<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    kind="descriptions"
    src="descriptions.vtt"
    srclang="en"
    label="Extended Audio Descriptions"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

```jsx
// React component for rendering video with extended audio descriptions

import React from 'react';

const VideoWithDescriptions = ({ videoSrc, descriptionsSrc }) => (

{" "}
<video controls>
  <source src={videoSrc} type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    kind="descriptions"
    src={descriptionsSrc}
    srclang="en"
    label="Extended Audio Descriptions"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
);

export default VideoWithDescriptions;

```
