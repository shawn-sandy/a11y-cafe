Creating accessible multimedia content is a key aspect of ensuring web
accessibility. One important feature for making video content accessible to
users with visual impairments is the use of **extended audio description**. This
article will explore what extended audio descriptions are, why they are
important, how they fit into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
2.2, and best practices for implementation.

#### What is Extended Audio Description?

Extended audio description refers to the additional narration added to video
content to describe important visual elements that are not conveyed through the
main audio track. This narration provides essential context and information,
enabling users with visual impairments to understand the visual content fully.
Unlike standard audio descriptions, extended audio descriptions may require the
video to be paused to allow more time for these descriptions to be provided.

#### Why is Extended Audio Description Important?

1. **Inclusive Access**: It ensures that users with visual impairments have
   access to the same information as sighted users, promoting inclusivity.
2. **Enhanced Understanding**: Provides detailed descriptions of visual
   elements, actions, and other important details that are otherwise
   inaccessible.
3. **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**: Helps content creators meet
   accessibility standards and legal requirements.

#### WCAG 2.2 Guidelines and Success Criteria

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 include criteria
specifically related to audio descriptions:

1. **1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)** (Level AAA)
   - **Description**: Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow
     audio descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio
     descriptions are provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized
     media.
   - **Example**: Adding extended audio descriptions to a training video where
     critical visual information is conveyed rapidly and cannot be described
     during natural pauses.

#### Implementing Extended Audio Descriptions

1. **Script Preparation**: Create a detailed script that includes all visual
   information necessary for understanding the content. Identify where extended
   descriptions are needed.
2. **Timing and Synchronization**: Ensure that the video can be paused or slowed
   down to allow the extended descriptions to be included without overlapping
   the main audio.
3. **Professional Narration**: Use clear and concise narration by a professional
   voice artist to provide extended descriptions.
4. **Integration**: Integrate the extended audio descriptions into the video
   using video editing software, ensuring that they are synchronized properly
   with the visual content.

   ```html
   <video controls>
     <source src="video-with-extended-audio-description.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
   </video>
   ```

#### Best Practices for Extended Audio Descriptions

1. **Clarity and Detail**: Provide clear, concise, and detailed descriptions of
   all relevant visual elements, including actions, expressions, settings, and
   other important details.
2. **User Control**: Ensure that users have control over playback to pause,
   rewind, or skip through descriptions as needed.
3. **Consistent Quality**: Maintain a high standard of audio quality and
   consistency throughout the descriptions.
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users with visual impairments to
   continually improve the quality and effectiveness of the audio descriptions.

#### Example of Extended Audio Description

Consider a scene in a video where a character silently picks up a mysterious
object and examines it closely. The extended audio description might be:

> "The character slowly reaches out and picks up a small, intricately carved
> wooden box. She turns it over in her hands, examining the detailed patterns
> and symbols etched into the surface. Her brow furrows in concentration as she
> tries to decipher the markings."
