## Robust 4

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The "Robust" guideline
(4.1) focuses on ensuring that content is compatible with current and future
user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Guideline 4.1: Compatibility

The Robust guideline aims to maximize the compatibility of web content with
current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. This guideline
has two success criteria:

### 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A)

This success criterion requires that web pages have valid markup, following the
specifications for the language or markup format being used. Valid markup helps
ensure that user agents, including assistive technologies, can accurately
interpret and render the content.

Best practices:

- Use valid HTML, CSS, and other markup languages.
- Validate your code regularly using automated tools.
- Avoid using non-standard or deprecated features.

### 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)

This success criterion requires that all user interface components have their
name, role, and value properties properly set, so that assistive technologies
can accurately convey their purpose and state to users.

Best practices:

- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately.
- Provide clear and descriptive labels for form controls.
- Ensure that dynamic content updates are conveyed to assistive technologies.

By following the Robust guideline, you can ensure that your web content is
compatible with a wide range of user agents, including assistive technologies,
and provide an accessible experience for all users. Robust
