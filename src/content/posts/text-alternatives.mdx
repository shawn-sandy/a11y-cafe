# Text Alternatives - Providing Text for Non-Text Content

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
web content more accessible to people with disabilities. One of the key
principles is providing text alternatives for non-text content, such as images,
audio, and video.

## Relevant WCAG 2.2 Guidelines

### 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

This guideline requires that all non-text content that is presented to the user
has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose. This includes images,
graphical objects, symbols, audio, video, and other multimedia content.

The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that all users, including those who
are blind, have low vision, or have cognitive disabilities, can access and
understand the information conveyed by non-text content.

Best practices:

- Provide descriptive and meaningful alt text for images that convey important
  information or context.
- For decorative images that do not convey meaningful information, use an empty
  alt attribute (`alt=""`).
- For audio and video content, provide transcripts or captions.
- For complex images or charts, provide a long description or a link to a
  text-based alternative.
