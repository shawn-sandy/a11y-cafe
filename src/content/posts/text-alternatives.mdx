## Introduction

Text alternatives are a fundamental aspect of web accessibility, ensuring that
non-text content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) emphasize the importance of
providing text alternatives for non-text content to ensure an inclusive user
experience. This article will explain the relevant WCAG guidelines and success
criteria related to text alternatives, and provide practical examples and best
practices for implementation.

## WCAG Guidelines for Text Alternatives

### 1.1 Text Alternatives (Guideline 1.1)

**Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed
into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or
simpler language.**

#### 1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

- **Requirement:** All non-text content that is presented to the user must have
  a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
- **Purpose:** Ensures that users who cannot see or hear the non-text content
  can understand its purpose through text descriptions.

### Examples of Text Alternatives

#### Example 1: Images

Images should always have an `alt` attribute that describes their content.

```html
<img src="mountains.jpg" alt="A scenic view of mountains during sunset" />
```

#### Example 2: Decorative Images

Decorative images, which do not add meaningful content, should have an empty
`alt` attribute.

```html
<img src="decorative-border.png" alt="" />
```

#### Example 3: Complex Images

For complex images like graphs or diagrams, provide a longer description using
`aria-describedby` or a link to a detailed description.

```html
<img
  src="sales-chart.png"
  alt="Sales chart for Q1 2024"
  aria-describedby="chart-description"
/>
<p id="chart-description">
  This chart shows a significant increase in sales during the first quarter of
  2024...
</p>
```

#### Example 4: Audio Content

Provide a transcript for audio content.

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="podcast.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<p>Transcript: Welcome to our podcast. Today, we will discuss...</p>
```

#### Example 5: Video Content

Provide captions and transcripts for video content.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track src="captions_en.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>Transcript: This video explains the features of our new product...</p>
```

## Best Practices for Implementing Text Alternatives

1. **Use Descriptive Alt Text for Images:**

   - Ensure that alt text is meaningful and describes the content and function
     of the image.
   - Avoid using phrases like "image of" or "picture of."

2. **Provide Transcripts and Captions:**

   - For all audio and video content, provide accurate and synchronized captions
     and transcripts.
   - Ensure that captions are readable and appear at a consistent pace.

3. **Use ARIA for Complex Content:**

   - Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide
     additional context and information for complex non-text content.
   - Examples include `aria-describedby` for detailed descriptions and
     `aria-label` for labels.

4. **Ensure Decorative Images are Ignored:**

   - Use empty `alt` attributes for decorative images to ensure screen readers
     ignore them.

5. **Test with Assistive Technologies:**
   - Regularly test your content with screen readers and other assistive
     technologies to ensure that text alternatives are effective and useful.
