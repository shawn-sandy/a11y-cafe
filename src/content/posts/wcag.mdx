# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 are a set of recommendations
for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. These
guidelines are developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and are widely
recognized as the international standard for web accessibility.

## Perceivable

### 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus

This guideline requires that content that becomes available on hover or keyboard
focus should be dismissible, hoverable, and persistent. This ensures that users
with disabilities can access and interact with the content effectively.

**Purpose:** To ensure that users with disabilities can perceive and interact
with content that appears on hover or focus.

**Best Practices:**

- Provide a mechanism to dismiss the content, such as an "X" button or an "Esc"
  key.
- Ensure that the content remains visible until the user dismisses it or moves
  the pointer or focus away.
- Allow users to hover over the content without triggering additional events or
  content changes.

**Example:**

<div class="tooltip">
  Hover over me
  <span class="tooltip-text">
    This is a tooltip that appears on hover.
    <button class="close-btn">X</button>
  </span>
</div>

### 1.4.14 Label in Name

This guideline requires that the name and role of user interface components are
programmatically determinable. This helps users with disabilities understand the
purpose and functionality of the components.

**Purpose:** To ensure that users with disabilities can identify and understand
the purpose of user interface components.

**Best Practices:**

- Use appropriate HTML elements and attributes to provide semantic meaning
  (e.g., `<button>`, `<input>`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`).
- Ensure that the label accurately describes the component's purpose and
  functionality.
- Avoid using placeholder text as a substitute for a label.

**Example:**
```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username" aria-label="Enter your username"/>
```
