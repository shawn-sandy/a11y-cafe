# Operable

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
web content more operable for users with disabilities. The "Operable" principle
focuses on ensuring that all functionality is available from a keyboard,
providing users enough time to read and use content, and helping users navigate
and find content.

## Keyboard Accessible (2.1)

All functionality should be available from a keyboard interface, without
requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. This allows users who
cannot use a mouse or other pointing device to access all content and
functionality.

Best practices:

- Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form controls) can be reached
  and operated using only the keyboard.
- Provide visible keyboard focus indicators to help users track their location
  on the page.
- Avoid interactions that require specific timings or path-based gestures.

## Enough Time (2.2)

Users should have enough time to read and use content. This includes allowing
users to pause, stop, or extend time limits, and providing mechanisms to request
more time if needed.

Best practices:

- Avoid time limits or provide a way to extend or disable them.
- If time limits are necessary, warn users before the time expires and allow
  them to request more time.
- Ensure that moving, blinking, or auto-updating content can be paused or
  stopped.

## Navigable (2.4)

Users should be able to easily navigate and find content. This includes
providing ways to bypass repetitive content, descriptive page titles and
headings, and clear navigation mechanisms.

Best practices:

- Provide a "skip to main content" link at the top of each page.
- Use descriptive and hierarchical headings to structure content.
- Provide clear and consistent navigation mechanisms (menus, breadcrumbs, etc.).
- Ensure that links and controls have descriptive and meaningful labels.

## Input Modalities (2.5)

Users should be able to operate functionality through various inputs beyond
keyboard, such as speech, gestures, or eye-tracking.

Best practices:

- Support alternative input modalities where possible (e.g., speech recognition,
  eye-tracking).
- Ensure that functionality is not limited to specific input modalities.
