When discussing web accessibility, "operable" refers to ensuring that all user interface components and navigation are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This concept is one of the four main principles outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), specifically focusing on making sure that interactive elements can be operated in various ways, not just through a mouse.

#### Why Operability Matters

For many users, standard interaction methods like using a mouse may not be feasible due to various disabilities. Therefore, ensuring that all functionality is available from a keyboard, voice command, or assistive technology is crucial. An operable website provides a more inclusive and equitable user experience.

### Key WCAG 2.2 Guidelines for Operability

#### 1. Keyboard Accessible (Guideline 2.1)
**Success Criteria:**
- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality must be available via keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component, it must be possible to move away from the component using only the keyboard.

**Example:**
```html
<a href="#maincontent" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click me</button>
```
In the example above, the button can be activated using the keyboard.

#### 2. Enough Time (Guideline 2.2)
**Success Criteria:**
- **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable**: If content has a time limit, users should be able to adjust, extend, or disable the time limit.
- **2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide**: Users must be able to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content.

**Example:**
```html
<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
The controls attribute ensures users can pause and control the video playback.

#### 3. Seizures and Physical Reactions (Guideline 2.3)
**Success Criteria:**
- **2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below**: Content should not flash more than three times in any one-second period, or the flash should be below the threshold.

**Example:**
```css
/* Avoiding rapid flashing in CSS animations */
@keyframes safe-flash {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0; }
}
```

#### 4. Navigable (Guideline 2.4)
**Success Criteria:**
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: Provide a mechanism to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages.
- **2.4.2 Page Titled**: Web pages should have titles that describe the topic or purpose.
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Ensure that when a user navigates sequentially through content, they encounter elements in a meaningful order.
- **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)**: The purpose of each link should be clear from the link text alone or in conjunction with its surrounding context.

**Example:**
```html
<a href="#content">Skip to main content</a>

<h1>Accessibility Guide</h1>
<p id="content">Welcome to the guide on web accessibility...</p>
```

#### 5. Input Modalities (Guideline 2.5)
**Success Criteria:**
- **2.5.1 Pointer Gestures**: All functionality should be operable through simple gestures like single tap or click.
- **2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation**: Ensure that accidental or unintended activation of an interface element is minimized.

**Example:**
```html
<button ondblclick="alert('Double click activated!')">Double Click Me</button>
```

### Best Practices for Implementing Operable Guidelines

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test your website using only the keyboard to ensure all interactive elements are accessible.
2. **Adjustable Timers**: Provide users with options to adjust or disable time limits.
3. **Flash Content Control**: Avoid using flashing content that can cause seizures.
4. **Focus Management**: Ensure logical and intuitive focus order and manage focus states.
5. **Accessible Forms**: Ensure forms can be filled out and submitted using the keyboard and are labeled correctly for screen readers.
