ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes help enhance accessibility for web applications. One such attribute is `aria-expanded`. This attribute is crucial for users relying on assistive technologies, providing them with important information about the state of UI components that can expand or collapse content.

#### What is `aria-expanded`?

The `aria-expanded` attribute indicates whether a control, such as a button, a link, or a toggle, is expanded or collapsed. It is commonly used in components like accordions, menus, and dropdown lists. The attribute can have three possible values:
- **true**: The element is expanded and its content is visible.
- **false**: The element is collapsed and its content is hidden.
- **undefined (or omitted)**: The default state when the element does not control expandable content.

#### Why `aria-expanded` Matters

For users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers, knowing the state of interactive elements is vital for navigating and understanding web content. The `aria-expanded` attribute helps communicate whether additional content is available and visible, providing a better user experience.

#### Applying `aria-expanded` in Practice

Here are some best practices for using `aria-expanded`:

1. **Match with Visible State**: Ensure the value of `aria-expanded` always matches the visual state of the element. If the content is visible, `aria-expanded` should be `true`. If the content is hidden, `aria-expanded` should be `false`.
2. **Update Dynamically**: When the state of the element changes (e.g., a menu opens or closes), dynamically update the `aria-expanded` attribute to reflect the new state.
3. **Use with Appropriate Roles**: `aria-expanded` should be used with elements that have roles like `button`, `link`, or `menuitem` to ensure that the intended functionality is clear.

#### Example Code

Here's a simple example of how to use `aria-expanded` in a button that controls the visibility of a panel:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ARIA-Expanded Example</title>
    <style>
        #panel {
            display: none;
        }
        #panel[aria-expanded="true"] {
            display: block;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="toggleButton" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="panel">Show More</button>
    <div id="panel" role="region" aria-expanded="false">
        <p>This is the expandable content.</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('toggleButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
            var button = this;
            var panel = document.getElementById('panel');
            var isExpanded = button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';

            // Toggle the state
            button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isExpanded);
            panel.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isExpanded);

            // Optionally change button text
            button.textContent = isExpanded ? 'Show More' : 'Show Less';
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The button has an `aria-expanded` attribute set to `false` initially, indicating the panel is collapsed.
- The panel has a corresponding `aria-expanded` attribute that also starts as `false`.
- When the button is clicked, both `aria-expanded` attributes are toggled between `true` and `false`, and the panel's visibility is adjusted accordingly.


#### Why `aria-expanded` Matters for VoiceOver Users

VoiceOver users rely on auditory cues to navigate and understand web content. When `aria-expanded` is used correctly, it provides essential feedback about the state of expandable sections, making it easier for users to interact with and comprehend the content.

#### Implementing `aria-expanded` for VoiceOver

Here are best practices for using `aria-expanded` to ensure compatibility with VoiceOver:

1. **Consistent State Updates**: Always update the `aria-expanded` attribute dynamically to match the visual state of the element.
2. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure that elements with `aria-expanded` can be activated using the keyboard.
3. **Role and Labeling**: Use appropriate ARIA roles and labels to provide context about the expandable content.

#### Example Code

Here's an example of how to implement an accessible expandable section using `aria-expanded`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ARIA Expanded Example</title>
    <style>
        #content {
            display: none;
        }
        #content[aria-expanded="true"] {
            display: block;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="toggleButton" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="content">Show More</button>
    <div id="content" role="region" aria-expanded="false">
        <p>This is the expandable content.</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('toggleButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
            var button = this;
            var content = document.getElementById('content');
            var isExpanded = button.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';

            // Toggle the state
            button.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isExpanded);
            content.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isExpanded);

            // Optionally change button text
            button.textContent = isExpanded ? 'Show More' : 'Show Less';
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example:
- The button has `aria-expanded="false"` initially, indicating that the content is collapsed.
- The `div` element representing the expandable content also uses `aria-expanded` to indicate its current state.
- When the button is clicked, the `aria-expanded` attribute of both the button and the content is toggled, and the visibility of the content is adjusted accordingly.

#### VoiceOver Interaction

When a VoiceOver user navigates to the button:
- VoiceOver will announce the button's label and its `aria-expanded` state (e.g., "Show More, collapsed").
- After clicking the button, VoiceOver will announce the new state (e.g., "Show Less, expanded"), providing clear feedback that the content has been revealed.


#### Sufficient Techniques and Failures

**Techniques:**
- Using `aria-expanded` on a button to control the visibility of a panel or section.
- Updating the `aria-expanded` attribute dynamically with JavaScript when the controlled content's visibility changes.

**Failures:**
- Not updating the `aria-expanded` attribute when the state of the content changes, leading to a mismatch between the visual state and the ARIA state.
- Using `aria-expanded` on elements that do not control expandable content, causing confusion for assistive technology users.
