The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide guidance on making
pre-recorded audio-only and video-only content accessible. The relevant
guidelines are:

### 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)

For pre-recorded audio-only and pre-recorded video-only media, the following are
true, except when the audio or video is a media alternative for text and is
clearly labeled as such:

- **Pre-recorded Audio-only**: An alternative for time-based media is provided
  that presents equivalent information for pre-recorded audio-only content.
- **Pre-recorded Video-only**: Either an alternative for time-based media or an
  audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for pre-recorded
  video-only content.

The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that users who cannot perceive the
audio or video content can still access the information it conveys. This can be
achieved by providing text transcripts, captions, or audio descriptions.

### Best Practices

- **Transcripts**: Provide text transcripts for pre-recorded audio-only content,
  such as podcasts or audio interviews. Transcripts should accurately represent
  the spoken content, including speaker identification and relevant non-speech
  sounds.
- **Captions**: For pre-recorded video-only content, provide synchronized
  captions that accurately represent the audio content, including relevant
  non-speech sounds.
- **Audio Descriptions**: For pre-recorded video-only content, consider
  providing audio descriptions that describe relevant visual information for
  users who cannot perceive the video.
- **Clearly Label Alternatives**: If the audio or video is an alternative for
  text content, clearly label it as such to avoid the need for additional
  alternatives.
