### 1.2.6 Sign Language (Prerecorded) (AAA)

This guideline states that sign language interpretation should be provided for
prerecorded audio content in synchronized media.

**Purpose:** To make prerecorded audio content accessible to individuals who are
deaf or hard of hearing and use sign language as their primary language.

**How it applies:** If your website or application includes prerecorded audio
content, such as videos or podcasts, you should provide a sign language
interpretation for that content.

**Best practices:**

- Hire qualified sign language interpreters to translate the audio content into
  sign language.
- Ensure the sign language interpretation is synchronized with the audio
  content.
- Position the sign language interpreter in a visible area of the video.
- Provide clear contrast between the interpreter and the background.

**Example:**

 ```html
<div class="video-container">
    <video controls>
        <source src="main-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <div class="sign-language-overlay">
        <video muted autoplay loop>
            <source src="sign-language-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>
</div>

 ```
 In  this example, the main video content is accompanied by a sign language cideo overlay that provides a sign language interpretation of the audio content.
 
 **Conformance Level:** AAA
