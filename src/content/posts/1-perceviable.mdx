Perceivable, focuses on ensuring that information and user interface components are presentable to users in ways they can understand by using sight, sound or other assitive technologies. This principle encompasses guidelines related to providing text alternatives for non-text content, ensuring sufficient color contrast, providing captions and alternatives for multimedia, and making content adaptable or available to assistive technologies.

## Guidelines

1. **Text Alternatives**: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content,
   such as images, icons, and multimedia, so that it can be changed into other
   forms that people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or
   simpler language.

2. **Time-based Media**: Provide alternatives for time-based media, such as
   captions for audio and audio descriptions for video.

3. **Adaptable**: Create content that can be presented in different ways without
   losing information or structure, so that it can be adapted to meet the needs
   of different users, including those with disabilities.

4. **Distinguishable**: Make it easier for users to see and hear content,
   including separating foreground from background, ensuring sufficient color
   contrast, and providing alternatives for audio and visual information.

## Purpose and Best Practices

The purpose of the Perceivable principle is to ensure that all users, regardless
of their abilities or disabilities, can access and understand the information
and user interface components on a website or application. By following these
guidelines, you can create a more inclusive and accessible experience for
everyone.

Best practices for implementing the Perceivable principle include:

- Providing text alternatives for all non-text content, such as images, icons,
  and multimedia.
- Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background colors.
- Providing captions and audio descriptions for multimedia content.
- Using clear and concise language in your content.
- Designing user interfaces that can be adapted or customized to meet individual
  needs.
