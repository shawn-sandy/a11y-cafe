### WCAG 2.2 Guideline 1.2.5 (AA)

The Audio Description (Prerecorded) guideline requires that prerecorded audio
content in synchronized media provides an audio description of the video
content. An audio description is a narration that describes important visual
details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone. This helps
users who are blind or have low vision to better understand the content.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that users who cannot
perceive visual information can still access and understand the content through
audio descriptions.

**How it Applies:** This guideline applies to prerecorded audio-visual content,
such as movies, TV shows, and online videos. It does not apply to live
audio-visual content or audio-only content.

**Best Practices:**

- Provide an audio description track that describes relevant visual information,
  such as actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text.
- The audio description should be clear, concise, and objective, without
  personal interpretation or commentary.
- The audio description should be timed to fit between the existing dialogue or
  narration, without overlapping or obscuring important audio content.
- Provide a mechanism for users to turn the audio description on or off, such as
  a separate audio track or a user setting.

**Example:**

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track kind="descriptions" src="descriptions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English Audio Description">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

In this example, the `<track>` element provides an audio description track in
WebVTT format for the video. The `kind="descriptions"` attribute indicates that
it is an audio description track, and the `srclang="en"` attribute specifies the
language as English.
