The WCAG 2.2 guideline "Audio Description (Prerecorded)" requires that
prerecorded audio content in synchronized media provides descriptive narration
of key visual information, including any contextual visuals necessary for
understanding the content.

### Purpose

Audio descriptions help make visual information accessible to people who are
blind or have low vision. They provide a verbal description of important visual
details, actions, and scenes that are essential for understanding the content.

### How it Applies

This guideline applies to prerecorded audio-visual content, such as movies, TV
shows, online videos, and multimedia presentations. It does not apply to live
audio content or audio-only content.

### Best Practices

- Provide audio descriptions for all important visual information, including
  actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text.
- Ensure that the audio descriptions are clear, concise, and objective, without
  personal interpretation or commentary.
- Time the audio descriptions to fit within natural pauses or gaps in the
  existing audio track, without interfering with important dialogue or sound
  effects.
- Offer separate audio description tracks or versions of the content, allowing
  users to choose whether to enable or disable the descriptions.

### Code Examples

This example demonstrates how to add an audio description track to a video using the `<track>` element. The kind attribute is set to "descriptions", and the src attribute points to the VTT file containing the audio descriptions.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="audio-description.vtt" kind="descriptions" srclang="en" label="English Audio Description">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

```

In this example, an alternative version of the video with audio descriptions is provided via a link. This allows users to choose between the original video and the version with audio descriptions.


```html
<a href="video-with-descriptions.mp4">
  Watch the video with audio descriptions
</a>

```

This example uses ARIA attributes to indicate the availability of audio descriptions. The aria-describedby attribute on the `<video>` element references the id of the element containing the note about audio descriptions.

```html
<div role="region" aria-label="Video Player">
  <video controls aria-describedby="audio-description-note">
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  <p id="audio-description-note">
    This video includes audio descriptions.
  </p>
</div>

```
