The WCAG 2.2 guidelines for Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)
are covered under the **1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)** success
criterion. This criterion has a **AA** conformance level.

**Purpose**: The purpose of this guideline is to ensure that prerecorded audio
content, such as videos or audio files, is accessible to users who are blind or
have low vision by providing an alternative in the form of audio descriptions.

**How it Applies**: This guideline applies to all prerecorded audio content,
including videos, audio files, and other multimedia content that contains audio
information. Audio descriptions provide a narration of the relevant visual
information, such as actions, scene changes, and other important visual cues, to
help users who cannot see the content understand what is happening.

**Best Practices**:

- Provide audio descriptions for all prerecorded audio content that contains
  important visual information.
- Audio descriptions should be clear, concise, and accurately describe the
  relevant visual information.
- Audio descriptions should be synchronized with the audio content and should
  not interfere with the original audio.
- Provide a mechanism for users to turn audio descriptions on or off, or to
  adjust the volume of the audio descriptions separately from the main audio.

**Code Examples**:

```html
<!-- HTML5 video with audio descriptions -->

<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track kind="descriptions" src="descriptions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English Audio Descriptions">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

```html
<!-- HTML5 audio with audio descriptions -->

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <track kind="descriptions" src="descriptions.vtt" srclang="en" label="English Audio Descriptions">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
```
