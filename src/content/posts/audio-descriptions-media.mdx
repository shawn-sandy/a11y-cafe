Audio descriptions and media alternatives are crucial for making prerecorded
video content accessible to users who are blind or have low vision. These
alternatives ensure that all users can fully understand and engage with the
visual information presented in videos.

### What is an Audio Description?

An audio description is a narration track that describes important visual
elements of a video, such as actions, scene changes, gestures, and other key
visual content. These descriptions are inserted during natural pauses in the
dialogue or audio.

### Why Are Audio Descriptions Important?

Audio descriptions help users who are blind or have low vision to understand
visual content that they would otherwise miss. This includes important actions,
scene changes, and on-screen text that are critical for comprehending the video.

### WCAG 2.2 Guideline 1.2.3: Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)

### Level A

### 1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)

**Requirement**: Provide an audio description for all prerecorded video content
in synchronized media, or provide a media alternative that presents equivalent
information.

### How to Implement Audio Descriptions

1. **Creating Audio Descriptions**:

   - Write a script that describes key visual elements in the video.
   - Record the audio description and synchronize it with the video.
   - Insert the audio description into the video during natural pauses.

2. **Using Media Alternatives**:
   - Provide a text transcript that includes both the spoken dialogue and
     descriptions of the visual content.
   - Ensure that the transcript is easy to locate and access.

### Example of an Audio Description

Here is an example of how to include an audio description in an HTML5 video
element:

<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    kind="descriptions"
    src="descriptions_en.vtt"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

In this example, the `<track>` element with `kind="descriptions"` points to a
file (`descriptions_en.vtt`) that contains the audio description in WebVTT
format.

### Example of a Media Alternative

If providing an audio description is not feasible, a media alternative such as a
detailed text transcript can be used:

<video controls>
  <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>
  Transcript: This video shows a beach scene with waves crashing on the shore.
  People are walking along the beach, and a child is building a sandcastle...
</p>

In this example, the transcript provides a detailed description of the visual
content in the video, allowing users who cannot see the video to understand what
is happening.

### Best Practices for Audio Descriptions and Media Alternatives

1. **Clear and Concise Descriptions**: Ensure that audio descriptions are clear,
   concise, and accurately describe the visual content without overwhelming the
   user.

2. **Timing**: Insert audio descriptions during natural pauses in the video's
   audio to avoid overlapping with dialogue or important sounds.

3. **Accessible Formats**: Provide transcripts in accessible formats, such as
   HTML or plain text, and ensure they are easy to find and use.

4. **User Choice**: Allow users to choose whether to access the audio
   description or the media alternative, based on their preferences and needs.
