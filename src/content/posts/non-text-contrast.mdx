### Introduction

Non-text elements, such as user interface components and graphical objects, are
integral to the usability and accessibility of web content. The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 include specific criteria to ensure that
non-text elements have sufficient contrast, making them easily distinguishable
for all users, including those with visual impairments. This article will
explain these guidelines, their importance, and provide practical examples and
best practices.

### Why Non-Text Contrast Matters

Adequate contrast for non-text elements helps users identify and interact with
different components on a web page, such as buttons, icons, form controls, and
visual indicators. Insufficient contrast can make it difficult for users to
distinguish these elements, hindering navigation and functionality.

### Relevant WCAG 2.2 Guidelines

### 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast

**Level AA**: This criterion requires that visual information used to identify
user interface components and graphical objects have a contrast ratio of at
least 3:1 against adjacent colors. This includes controls, input fields, and any
other interactive elements.

#### Example:

Ensuring that buttons and other interactive elements are easily distinguishable
from their backgrounds.

**Incorrect:**

```html
<!-- Button with insufficient contrast -->
<button
  style="color: #AAAAAA; background-color: #CCCCCC; border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;"
>
  Submit
</button>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<!-- Button with sufficient contrast -->
<button
  style="color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #007BFF; border: 1px solid #0056b3;"
>
  Submit
</button>
```

In the correct example, the button's text and background colors have a contrast
ratio of at least 3:1, making it more visible and easier to identify.

## Best Practices for Ensuring Non-Text Contrast

1. **High Contrast Colors**: Use color combinations that provide sufficient
   contrast for user interface components and graphical objects. Verify contrast
   ratios using tools like the
   [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
2. **Consistent Design**: Maintain consistent color schemes and contrast levels
   across your website to help users quickly recognize and interact with
   different elements.
3. **State Indicators**: Ensure that focus indicators, hover states, and active
   states of interactive elements have sufficient contrast to be easily
   distinguishable.
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Conduct regular accessibility testing with users,
   including those with visual impairments, to ensure that non-text elements are
   easily distinguishable and usable.

### Additional Examples

#### Form Controls:

**Incorrect:**

```html
<!-- Input field with insufficient contrast -->
<input
  type="text"
  style="color: #666666; background-color: #EEEEEE; border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;"
  placeholder="Enter your name"
/>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<!-- Input field with sufficient contrast -->
<input
  type="text"
  style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #000000;"
  placeholder="Enter your name"
/>
```

#### Icons and Graphical Objects:

**Incorrect:**

```html
<!-- Icon with insufficient contrast -->
<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="color: #CCCCCC;"></i>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<!-- Icon with sufficient contrast -->
<i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="color: #007BFF;"></i>
```

### Using CSS for Non-Text Contrast

Use CSS to ensure that non-text elements have sufficient contrast against their
backgrounds.

#### Example:

```css
/* CSS for high contrast button */
.high-contrast-button {
  color: #ffffff; /* White text */
  background-color: #007bff; /* Blue background */
  border: 1px solid #0056b3; /* Darker blue border */
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

/* CSS for high contrast input field */
.high-contrast-input {
  color: #000000; /* Black text */
  background-color: #ffffff; /* White background */
  border: 1px solid #000000; /* Black border */
  padding: 5px;
}
```

```html
<!-- Applying the high contrast classes -->
<button class="high-contrast-button">Submit</button>
<input type="text" class="high-contrast-input" placeholder="Enter your name" />
```
