### Introduction

Visual presentation is a critical aspect of web design, affecting how users
perceive and interact with content. Accessible visual presentation ensures that
all users, including those with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or
other challenges, can access and understand web content effectively. The Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 outline criteria to make visual
presentation accessible. This article will explain these guidelines, their
importance, and provide practical examples and best practices.

### Why Accessible Visual Presentation Matters

An accessible visual presentation ensures that content is readable, navigable,
and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. It helps users with low
vision, color blindness, and cognitive disabilities to access information
without barriers, creating an inclusive online environment.

### Relevant WCAG 2.2 Guidelines

##### 1.4.8 Visual Presentation

**Level AAA**: This criterion focuses on the visual presentation of text blocks,
ensuring they are easy to read and understand. It includes specific requirements
for text size, line spacing, paragraph spacing, and contrast.

###### Requirements:

1. **Foreground and Background Contrast**: Text has a contrast ratio of at least
   7:1, except for large text (which requires a 4.5:1 ratio).
2. **Text Resize**: Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or
   functionality.
3. **Line Height (Line Spacing)**: Line height (line spacing) is at least 1.5
   times the font size.
4. **Paragraph Spacing**: Spacing following paragraphs is at least 2 times the
   font size.
5. **Text Alignment**: Text is not justified (aligned to both left and right
   margins).
6. **Text Colors**: Allow users to select their own foreground and background
   colors.
7. **No Background Image**: Ensure background images do not interfere with
   readability.

#### Example of Proper Visual Presentation:

**Incorrect:**

```html
<!-- Text with insufficient contrast and poor spacing -->
<p
  style="color: #666666; background-color: #FFFFFF; line-height: 1.2; text-align: justify;"
>
  This is a paragraph of text that is difficult to read due to low contrast,
  tight line spacing, and justified alignment.
</p>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<!-- Text with sufficient contrast and good spacing -->
<p
  style="color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 2em; text-align: left;"
>
  This is a paragraph of text that is easy to read due to high contrast, proper
  line spacing, and left-aligned text.
</p>
```

### Best Practices for Accessible Visual Presentation

1. **Ensure High Contrast**: Use color combinations that provide sufficient
   contrast between text and background. Use tools like the
   [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to
   verify contrast ratios.
2. **Avoid Justified Text**: Align text to the left to avoid uneven spacing
   between words, which can make reading difficult.
3. **Adequate Spacing**: Use adequate line height and paragraph spacing to
   improve readability.
4. **Flexible Text Size**: Allow users to resize text up to 200% without losing
   functionality or content.
5. **User-Controlled Colors**: Enable users to customize foreground and
   background colors to suit their preferences.
6. **Minimize Background Images**: Avoid using background images behind text, or
   ensure they do not reduce text readability.

#### Additional Examples

###### Text Alignment:

**Incorrect:**

```html
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This text is justified, which can create uneven spacing and make it harder to
  read.
</p>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<p style="text-align: left;">
  This text is left-aligned, making it easier to read.
</p>
```

###### Line and Paragraph Spacing:

**Incorrect:**

```html
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  This text has tight line spacing and insufficient paragraph spacing, which can
  make it harder to read.
</p>
```

**Correct:**

```html
<p style="line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 2em;">
  This text has adequate line spacing and sufficient paragraph spacing, making
  it easier to read.
</p>
```

#### Using CSS for Visual Presentation

Use CSS to ensure text is presented in an accessible manner.

###### Example:

```css
/* CSS for accessible text presentation */
.accessible-text {
  color: #000000; /* Black text */
  background-color: #ffffff; /* White background */
  line-height: 1.5; /* 1.5 times the font size */
  margin-bottom: 2em; /* 2 times the font size for paragraph spacing */
  text-align: left; /* Left-aligned text */
}
```

```html
<!-- Applying the accessible text class -->
<p class="accessible-text">
  This is a paragraph of text that is easy to read due to high contrast, proper
  line spacing, and left-aligned text.
</p>
```
