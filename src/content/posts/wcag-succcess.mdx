The WCAG success criteria provide specific and testable guidelines to ensure web content is accessible to people with a variety of disabilities. They help web developers, designers, and content creators understand what needs to be done to make their content accessible. Here's a more detailed look at what they are and why they matter:

### Why WCAG Success Criteria Matter

1. **Inclusive Design:** The criteria help create content that is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities.
2. **Legal Compliance:** Many countries have laws requiring web accessibility. Meeting WCAG success criteria can help organizations comply with these laws.
3. **Better User Experience:** Accessible design often improves the overall user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.
4. **Market Reach:** Making content accessible broadens the potential audience, reaching users who might otherwise be excluded.
5. **Social Responsibility:** Adhering to accessibility guidelines demonstrates a commitment to social inclusion and equality.

### What the Success Criteria Do

#### Perceivable

1. **Text Alternatives:** Provide alternatives for non-text content (like images) so that it can be changed into other forms (like large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language).
   - Example: Adding alt text to images.
   
2. **Time-based Media:** Provide alternatives for audio and video content.
   - Example: Captions for videos.
   
3. **Adaptable:** Ensure content can be presented in different ways without losing meaning.
   - Example: Using semantic HTML to structure content.

4. **Distinguishable:** Make it easier for users to see and hear content.
   - Example: Using sufficient contrast between text and background.

#### Operable

1. **Keyboard Accessible:** Ensure all functionality is available via keyboard.
   - Example: Making sure users can navigate a site using the Tab key.

2. **Enough Time:** Give users enough time to read and interact with content.
   - Example: Providing mechanisms to extend time limits.

3. **Seizures and Physical Reactions:** Avoid content that can cause seizures.
   - Example: Avoiding flashing content.

4. **Navigable:** Help users navigate and find content.
   - Example: Using clear headings and providing a site map.

5. **Input Modalities:** Support different input methods beyond just keyboards.
   - Example: Ensuring touch controls are accessible.

#### Understandable

1. **Readable:** Make text content readable and understandable.
   - Example: Using plain language and defining jargon.
   
2. **Predictable:** Ensure web pages behave in predictable ways.
   - Example: Consistent navigation and design.

3. **Input Assistance:** Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
   - Example: Providing error messages and suggestions.

#### Robust

1. **Compatible:** Ensure content is compatible with current and future tools.
   - Example: Using clean, standards-compliant HTML and CSS.

By meeting these criteria, web content becomes more accessible, which benefits not only people with disabilities but all users, enhancing the overall user experience and usability of web content.
