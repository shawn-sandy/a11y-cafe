The WCAG 2.2 guidelines provide specific requirements for providing captions for
live audio content, such as live broadcasts, webinars, or video conferences.
These guidelines aim to ensure that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing
can access and understand the audio content.

## WCAG 2.2 Guidelines for Captions (Live)

The relevant WCAG 2.2 guideline for captions (live) is:

**1.2.4 Captions (Live)** (Level AA): Captions are provided for all live audio
content in synchronized media.

This guideline requires that captions be provided in real-time for live audio
content, such as live broadcasts, webinars, or video conferences. The captions
should be synchronized with the audio and provide a text representation of the
spoken content.

### Purpose and Best Practices

The purpose of providing captions for live audio is to ensure that individuals
who are deaf or hard of hearing can access and understand the audio content in
real-time. This is particularly important for live events, where the content is
time-sensitive and cannot be easily replayed or reviewed later.

Best practices for providing captions for live audio include:

1. **Use professional captioning services**: Professional captioning services
   can provide accurate and high-quality captions in real-time, ensuring that
   the captions are synchronized with the audio and accurately represent the
   spoken content.

2. **Provide clear and concise captions**: Captions should be clear, concise,
   and easy to read. They should accurately represent the spoken content,
   including important context and non-speech sounds.

3. **Ensure proper positioning and styling**: Captions should be positioned in a
   way that does not obscure important visual information and should be styled
   in a way that is easy to read, with appropriate font size, color, and
   contrast.

4. **Provide caption controls**: Users should have the ability to control the
   appearance and positioning of captions, such as adjusting the font size or
   color, or repositioning the captions on the screen.

5. **Test and monitor captions**: It is important to test and monitor the
   captions during live events to ensure that they are accurate and synchronized
   with the audio.

### Code Example

Here's a simple example of how to provide captions for live audio using the
`<track>` element in HTML5:

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>
```

In this example, the `<track>` element is used to specify the caption file
(`captions.vtt`) and its language (`srclang="en"`). The `kind="captions"`
attribute indicates that the track contains captions.
